# 3D coffee table cutlist optimizer
We have a very simple coffee table 3D model that can be parametrically adjusted to any dimension as preferred by the user. They can then click on the “Generate Cutlist” button which will then identify pieces to be cut and present them on a standard plywood sheet.

## Demo
Coming soon

## Commercial Development:
Commercial implementation or further development based on varied use cases is possible. Please contact connect@craftpixels.in  

## Features:
* **Parametric Generation:** The coffee table is created programmatically. Use the value sliders on the top right section to change the table dimensions or form.
* **Cut list generator :** Depending on the table you’ve created, the individual planks are identified, their dimensions are mapped to the cutlist optimizer to generate the pieces to be cut, which can help maximize material usage and minimize waste.
* **Export PDF :** You can export the generated cutlist as a PDF that can be shared with your carpenter. 

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository:
2. Install dependencies: npm run setup:install
3. Run the development server: npm run start
4. Access app at URL : http://localhost:8080

## Contributing:
You can export the generated cutlist as a PDF that can be shared with your carpenter.
